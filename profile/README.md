# TLG (The Licensing Group)

The Licensing Group (originally the Re-usable License Collaboration) was founded March 20, 2022. Our mission is to collect, and provide information about re-usable licenses (especially those within the opensource community).

# Project Status

We are slowly adding licenses, and articles. Currently there's not much here.

# Contributing

We are not currently accepting contributions. We encourage you to fork us!
