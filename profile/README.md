# TLG (The Licensing Group)

The Licensing Group (originally the Re-usable License Collaboration) was founded March 20, 2022. Our mission is to collect, and provide information about re-usable licenses (especially those within the opensource community).

# Project Status

Our website has just transitioned to a new design. Until we can get all our old content re-added, there isn't much on the site.

# Contributing
